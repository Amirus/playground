turtle
======

Expressing information, concepts and ideas in order to teach someone else gives
you a deeper understanding of your own knowledge and limitations.

The purpose of project turtle is to facilitate my own understanding of the
Japanese language. It is largely based on the awesome [WaniKani][] site and any
copyright related to WaniKani's design is still held by Tofugu LLC.

The main reason for duplicating this effort is that I learn from trying to
represent information in a clear and concise manner, which is of cause subject
to personal preferences.
